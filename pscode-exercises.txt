// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

open csv file
load into dataframe
read column 1, row 1
read column 1, row 2
sum(column1)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

open csv
load into dataframe
read column 1, row 1
divide the number by 2
	If the result is a whole number, it is an even number.
	IF the result has a fraction, it is an odd number.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are



open csv
load into a datafram
read column 1, rows 1 to 5
calculate the average/mean of (column 1) and save as column_avg
calculate the min of (column 1) and save as column_min
calculate the max of (column 1) and save as column_min

print "I have read the csv that you provided.  I have calculated an average of (column_avg), a minimum value of (column_min), and a maximum value of (column_max)."
